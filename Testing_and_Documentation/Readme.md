Test cases analysis :

1. Assumptions :
                      - Interaction is only through available user interface.
                      - Manual generation of test cases.
                      - Stable Internet connection with a speed atleast enough to load average webpages.

2. Basic Testing :
                   - Basic vulnerabilities like sql injection do not work.
                   - Database responds actively to any changes appropriately.
                   - Access through urls without authentication or invalid urls are redirected to safe locatinos.

3. Layout testing :
                                    - Manual generation of test cases.
                                    - Required test cases have been placed in layouttesting.ods.
                                    - user Interfaces working according to expectations.

4. Fuctionality testing : 
                                  - Manual generation of test cases.
                                  - Required test cases have been placed in testing.ods.
                                  - Desired output achieved by all functionalities.

5. Conclusion :
               - Successful completion of testing without no errors related to functionalities and integration.
